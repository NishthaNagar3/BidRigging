# Bid Rigging Detection Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an anomaly detection system to detect potential bid rigging in procurement tenders. The solution involves:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
2. Feature engineering to create meaningful features for the model.
3. Building an anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest).
4. Implementing a Streamlit frontend for real-time predictions.
5. Simulating labels and training a supervised model to improve predictions.
